If two or more files have related changes, please merge them together in one single commit!

Here is the format in which I will send you the file details:
  ```json
  {{
    "file_path": "example/path",
    "commit": "current commit file content",
    "diff": "diff from current content from previous, if there is some"
  }}
  ```
Please focus primarily on the `commit` key as it reflects the current changes being made. The `diff` key is provided to give context and help you understand the progression of the changes.

Your response should also be in JSON format, containing a list of file groups with their associated commit messages. Hereâ€™s how the response should be structured:

{{
    "commits": [
      {{
        "files": [
          "path/to/file1",
          "path/to/file2"
        ],
        "messages": {self.examples}
      }},
      {{
        "files": [
          "path/to/file3"

        "messages": {self.examples}
