I need your help to generate commit messages using the Angular commit message convention for a series of code changes. I will provide you with the details of the file changes in JSON format. Each entry represents a group of logically related file changes, and for each group, I require five distinct commit messages that effectively capture the essence of the changes.


  Here is the format in which I will send you the file details:
  ```json
  {
    "file_path": "example/path",
    "previous_commit": "previous commit file content, if there is some"
    "commit": "current commit file content",
    "diff": "diff from current content from previous, if there is some"
  }
  ```

Please focus primarily on the `commit` key as it reflects the current changes being made. The `previous_commit` and `diff` keys are provided to give context and help you understand the progression of the changes.

If two or more files have related changes, please merge them together in one single commit!

Your response should also be in JSON format, containing a list of file groups with their associated commit messages. Hereâ€™s how the response should be structured:
  
{
    "commits": [
      {
        "files": [
          "path/to/file1",
          "path/to/file2"
        ],
        "messages": [
          "feat(scope): add new feature for X",
          "fix(scope): address bug in Y",
          "refactor(scope): improve code readability",
          "style(scope): update formatting",
          "docs(scope): enhance comments"
        ]
      },
      {
        "files": [
          "path/to/file3"
        ],
        "messages": [
          "chore(scope): update build scripts",
          "test(scope): add tests for Z",
          "perf(scope): improve performance of A",
          "ci(scope): modify CI pipeline",
          "build(scope): change build configuration"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
