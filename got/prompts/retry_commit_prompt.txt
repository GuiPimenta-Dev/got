I need your assistance to generate commit messages for a set of changes I'm about to make. I will provide you with the details of the files and their contents in JSON format. please suggest five distinct commit messages that accurately reflect the changes.
  
  Here is the format in which I will send you the file details:
 ```json
  {
    "file_path": "example/path",
    "previous_commit": "previous commit file content, if there is some"
    "commit": "current commit file content",
    "diff": "diff from current content from previous, if there is some"
  }
  ```

Please focus primarily on the `commit` key as it reflects the current changes being made. The `previous_commit` and `diff` keys are provided to give context and help you understand the progression of the changes.


Based on the content of these files, I would like you to use the Angular commit message convention to suggest commit messages. 
  
  The response should also be in JSON format, structured as follows: 
    {
      "messages": [
            "feat(scope): add new feature for X",
            "fix(scope): address bug in Y",
            "refactor(scope): improve code readability",
            "style(scope): update formatting",
            "docs(scope): enhance comments"
      ]
    }
