I need your assistance to generate commit messages for a set of changes I'm about to make. I will provide you with the details of the files and their contents in JSON format. For each logically grouped set of files, please suggest 5 distinct commit messages that accurately reflect the changes.
  
  Here is the format in which I will send you the file details:
  ```json
  {
    "file_path": "example/path",
    "previous_commit": "previous commit file content, if there is some"
    "commit": "current commit file content",
    "diff": "diff from current content from previous, if there is some"
  }
  ```
  Based on the content of these files, I would like you to use the Angular commit message convention to suggest commit messages. Each suggestion should contain a group of related files along with 5 commit messages that describe the changes comprehensively.
  
  The response should also be in JSON format, structured as follows: {
    "commits": [
      {
        "files": [
          "path/to/file1",
          "path/to/file2"
        ],
        "messages": [
          "feat(scope): add new feature for X",
          "fix(scope): address bug in Y",
          "refactor(scope): improve code readability",
          "style(scope): update formatting",
          "docs(scope): enhance comments"
        ]
      },
      {
        "files": [
          "path/to/file3"
        ],
        "messages": [
          "chore(scope): update build scripts",
          "test(scope): add tests for Z",
          "perf(scope): improve performance of A",
          "ci(scope): modify CI pipeline",
          "build(scope): change build configuration"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
