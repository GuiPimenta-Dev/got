I need your assistance to generate commit messages for a set of changes I'm about to make. I will provide you with the details of the files and their contents in JSON format. please suggest five distinct commit messages that accurately reflect the changes.
  
  Here is the format in which I will send you the file details:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "file_path": "example/path",
      "content": "example content of the file"
    }
  ]
  ```
  Based on the content of these files, I would like you to use the Angular commit message convention to suggest commit messages. 
  
  The response should also be in JSON format, structured as follows: 
    {
      "messages": [
            "feat(scope): add new feature for X",
            "fix(scope): address bug in Y",
            "refactor(scope): improve code readability",
            "style(scope): update formatting",
            "docs(scope): enhance comments"
      ]
    }
